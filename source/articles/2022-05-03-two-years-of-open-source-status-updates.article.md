Back in March of 2020, I decided to take up the habit of writing monthly status updates for my open source software development. 22 updates and 25k words later, I‚Äôm happy to be celebrating two years of status updates!

As each month ticks around, I can find it hard to break away from cutting code and write my updates, but every time I get to publishing, I‚Äôm really happy to have captured my progress and thinking.

After all, these posts now help remind me I managed to do all of the following over the last two years (and these were just the highlights!):

- Renamed dry-view to hanami-view and kicked off view/application integration ([Mar 2020](/writing/2020/03/27/open-source-status-update-march-2020))

- Added support for dry-system component dirs with mixed namespaces ([Feb](/writing/2021/03/09/open-source-status-update-february-2021)/[Mar/Apr 2021](/writing/2021/05/10/open-source-status-update-march-april-2021))

- Returned to dry-system and added configurable constant namespaces ([Jun](/writing/2021/07/11/open-source-status-update-june-2021)/[Jul/Aug](/writing/2021/09/06/open-source-status-update-july-august-2021)/[Sep](/writing/2021/10/11/open-source-status-update-september-2021)/[Oct 2021](/writing/2021/11/15/open-source-status-update-october-2021))

- Shipped a huge amount of dry-system improvements over two weeks of dedicated OSS time in [Jan 2022](/writing/2022/02/14/open-source-status-update-december-2021-january-2022), including the overhaul of bootable components as part of their rename to providers, as well as partial container imports and exports, plus much more
- Introduced concrete slice classes and other slice registration improvements to Hanami ([Feb 2022](/writing/2022/03/19/open-source-status-update-february-2022))
- Refactored and relocated action and view integration into the hanami gem itself, and introduced `Hanami::SliceConfigurable` to make it possible for similar components to integrate ([Mar 2022](/writing/2022/04/10/open-source-status-update-march-2022))

This is a lot! To add some extra colour here, a big difference betwen now and pre-2020 is that I‚Äôve been working on OSS exclusively in my personal time (nights and weekends), and I‚Äôve also been slugging away at a single large goal (Hanami 2.0, if you hadn‚Äôt heard!), and the combination of this can make the whole thing feel a little thankless. These monthly updates are timely punctuation and a valuable reminder that I am moving forward.

They also capture a lot of in-the-moment thinking that‚Äôd otherwise be lost to the sands of time. What I‚Äôve grown to realise with my OSS work is that it‚Äôs as much about the _process_ as anything else. For community-driven projects like dry-rb and Hanami, the work will be done when it‚Äôs done, and there's not particularly much we can do to hurry it. However, what we should never forget is to make that work-in-progress readily accessible to our community, to bring people along for the ride, and to share whatever lessons we discover along the way. The passing of each month is a wonderful opportunity for me to do this üòÄ

Finally, a huge thank you from me to anyone who reads these updates. Hearing from folks and knowing there are people out there following along is a huge encouragement to me.

So, let‚Äôs keep this going. I‚Äôm looking forward to another year of updates, and‚Äî_checks calendar_‚Äìwriting April‚Äôs post in the next week or so!
