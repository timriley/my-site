 ![Roxette in Hong Kong](2024250d8164.jpg)

I saw Roxette play live in Hong Kong last week, something I thought would never happen, given Marie's brain tumor, the band's extended hiatus, and my location in the southern hemisphere. So it was a pleasure and privilege to see this childhood favourite band of mine in person, along with my eager wife.

It was a great show. We were treated to new renditions of their songs (like a rock version of _Stars_, Per singing _Crash! Boom! Bang!_) and some masterful guitar work (like the epic extended solos in _7Twenty7_ and _The Look_). But what stood out the most to me was the unadulterated passion and energy they all expressed. It was truly inspiring; I hope to feel and act the same way after the next 25 years of doing what I do.
