In the last 48 hours, two friends and colleagues and I laboured over a brand new web app, for our entry in this year's&nbsp;[Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com/ "Rails Rumble"). The result is something we're proud to share with you:&nbsp;**[Ideas FTW!](http://ideasftw.com/ "Ideas FTW")**.

We all have plenty of ideas, most of which we never have the opportunity to act on. Ideas FTW is an idea _incubator_ that allows you to see your ideas come to life. You can vote on ideas, post your own, take up an idea and start an effort to achieve it on your own or in a group.

The site is simple and colourful, and will only become more fun to use as more ideas get added. So, please do sign up with your [OpenID](http://openid.net/ "OpenID") and empty your overflowing brains! I'm looking forward to seeing some interesting ideas fill the site.

Of course, the app is far from perfect yet. A few bugs slipped through and there are certainly a couple more key features we would like to add. If you have any suggestions for improving Ideas FTW, please feel free to [leave a comment on our effort page](http://ideasftw.com/efforts/1 "Ideas FTW effort page").

[Hugh](http://hughevans.net/ "Hugh Evans"), [Michael](http://starclass.com.au/ "Michael MacDonald")&nbsp;and I all had a great time working together to create this site. We learnt a great many new things over the weekend and I am sure that I can speak for the others to say the lack of sleep was worth it. If you enjoy the site, please feel free to [vote for us](http://railsrumble.com/teams/all-caps "Rails Rumble team page")&nbsp;when the tallies open in a couple of days.
