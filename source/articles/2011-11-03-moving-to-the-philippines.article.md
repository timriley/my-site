This Saturday, I am moving to the Philippines!

For a long time, I've wanted to spend an extended time overseas, to learn a new place, culture and language, and tackle all the interesting challenges that go along with it. Now, it's actually going to happen, thanks to my [equally adventurous wife](http://profiles.ayad.com.au/AyadProfileDetail.aspx?AmbassadorID=5938) and [flexible workplace](http://icelab.com.au/).

[![Location of Bacolod within the Visayas](83e2e859e310.jpg)](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bacolod+City,+Western+Visayas,+Philippines&hl=en&sll=12.071553,121.662598&sspn=9.101249,9.294434&vpsrc=0&hnear=Bacolod+City,+Negros+Occidental,+Western+Visayas,+Philippines&t=m&z=12)

I'll be living in [Bacolod, Negros Occidental](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacolod) and continuing my work for Icelab as usual. I'm really looking forward to getting involved with the web/mobile development community over there, both in the Philippines and in SE Asia in general. So if you're in the area, [please say hi!](/contact)

This also means that Icelab is much more easily available for hire in SE Asia. If you're after some finely crafted web or mobile apps, [get in touch](http://icelab.com.au/contact).

It's going to be a great adventure, and I can't wait to get started. I'll no doubt have plenty of interesting things to share, so be sure to follow me on [Tumblr](http://tumble.openmonkey.com/) and [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/timriley), where I'll be documenting my travel experiences.
